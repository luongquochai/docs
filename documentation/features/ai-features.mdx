API Lab now offers a set of AI-powered features designed to simplify core stages of the API development lifecycle. These include renaming of API requests, generation of structured request payloads, and scripting capabilities for pre-request logic and test cases.

<Warning> These AI features are currently in the `beta` stage and are exclusively available when client setup on `API Key` and `model` in [Settings](/documentation/features/customization#settings) page</Warning>

### Enable AI-powered features

To activate AI-powered features, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Settings** page within the API Lab application.
2. Open **API Key** and **Model** section.
3. Enter your **API Key** and **Model** and click on **Save** button.

<Tip> API Lab suggest you to use `gemini-2.0-flash` model for best performance and cost-effective</Tip>

### Rename API Requests

When saving an API request to a collection, click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** next to the request name field to have the system automatically assign a name based on the request's context and properties. Alternatively, you can use this feature to rename the pre-saved requests.

You can even customize the naming convention (e.g., CamelCase, PascalCase) through the **Request Naming Style** dropdown located in the **Experiments** section of the **Settings** page.

### Generate Request Body

Dynamically generate structured request payloads:

1. Click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** in the **Request Body** section.
2. Define constraints or provide input for the desired structure.
3. Validate the generated body and select **Accept Change** to populate the request body field.

### Generate Pre-request Scripts

Generate pre-request scripts to handle necessary setup operations before sending the request:

1. Click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** within the **Pre-request Script** section.
2. Enter specific logic or conditions required for the pre-request phase.
3. After reviewing the generated script, click **Accept Change** to apply it to the pre-request script section of your API request.

### Generate Scenario Cases
  
Build tests cases faster and reduce manual work with AI-Generated Scenario Cases:

1. Click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** in the **All Scenarios** section.
2. Specify the scenario parameters or expected outcomes.
3. Select **Accept Change** to integrate it into the scenario script editor for execution.

<Tip> Support the format excel cases and build with your description for each case. Please download template and enjoy !</Tip>
