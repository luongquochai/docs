User groups are a powerful feature that enables admins to manage user permissions and roles within a shared workspace. This structured approach allows for efficient control over access and actions, ensuring that users can only perform tasks relevant to their roles.

## Creating a User Group

1. Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard**.
2. Click on the **User** page > **User Groups** tab.
3. Click on the **Create Group** button.
4. Enter a **name** for the group.
5. Optionally, add a **description** to clarify the group's purpose.
6. Click on the **Create** button to finalize the group creation.

## Adding Users to a Group

1. In the **User Groups** tab, select the group you want to add users to.
2. Click on the **Add Users** button.
3. In the pop-up window, search for and select the users you want to add.
4. Click on the **Add** button to confirm your selection.

## Group Permissions

User groups can have different permissions based on their roles. Common permissions include:

- **Viewer**: Can view workspace data but cannot make changes.
- **Editor**: Can view and edit workspace data, but cannot manage user permissions.
- **Owner**: Has full control over the workspace, including managing users and permissions.

When creating or editing a group, admins can assign these roles to users within the group to ensure they have the appropriate level of access.

## Managing User Groups

User groups can be managed by admins to ensure that the right users have the appropriate permissions. This includes:

- **Editing Group Details**: Admins can modify the group's name and description by selecting the group and clicking on the **Edit** button.
- **Removing Users**: To remove users from a group, select the group, click on the **Manage Users** button, and then remove users as needed.
- **Deleting Groups**: If a group is no longer needed, admins can delete it by selecting the group and clicking on the **Delete Group** button.

## Best Practices

- **Define Clear Roles**: Establish clear roles and responsibilities for each user group to avoid confusion and ensure accountability.
- **Regularly Review Groups**: Periodically review user groups to ensure they still align with the organization's needs and that users have the appropriate permissions.
- **Use Descriptions**: Utilize the description field to provide context for each group, making it easier for admins to understand the purpose of each group at a glance.
- **Limit Group Size**: Keep user groups manageable in size to facilitate easier management and communication.
