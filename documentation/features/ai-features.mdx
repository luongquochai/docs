API Lab now offers a set of AI-powered features designed to simplify core stages of the API development lifecycle. These include renaming of API requests, generation of structured request payloads, and scripting capabilities for pre-request logic and test cases.

### Enable AI-powered features

To activate AI-powered features, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Settings** page within the API Lab application.
2. Scroll to the **Experiments** section.
3. Toggle the **AI Experiments** option to enable the features.

### Rename API Requests

When saving an API request to a collection, click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** next to the request name field to have the system automatically assign a name based on the request's context and properties. Alternatively, you can use this feature to rename the pre-saved requests.

You can even customize the naming convention (e.g., CamelCase, PascalCase) through the **Request Naming Style** dropdown located in the **Experiments** section of the **Settings** page.

### Generate Request Body

Dynamically generate structured request payloads:

1. Click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** in the **Request Body** section.
2. Define constraints or provide input for the desired structure.
3. Validate the generated body and select **Accept Change** to populate the request body field.

### Generate Pre-request Scripts

Generate pre-request scripts to handle necessary setup operations before sending the request:

1. Click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** within the **Pre-request Script** section.
2. Enter specific logic or conditions required for the pre-request phase.
3. After reviewing the generated script, click **Accept Change** to apply it to the pre-request script section of your API request.

### Generate Test Scripts

Develop test cases for your API workflow:

1. Click the **Modify with AI** icon **( .⟡⁺ )** in the **Tests** section.
2. Specify the test parameters or expected outcomes.
3. Select **Accept Change** to integrate it into the test script editor for execution.

### Generate Test Cases

Develop can generate test cases for your API with option modal or custom prompt.

1. Click the **Test Cases** tab on toolbar to show test cases tab.
2. Click the **Generate with AI** icon **( ⟡⁺ )** to open option modal.
3a. Select **Option Modal** to generate test cases with option modal.
3b. Select **Custom Prompt** to generate test cases with custom prompt.
4. Select **Accept Change** to integrate it into the test case editor for execution.
5. After accepting the test cases, you can run it by clicking the **Run** icon **( ▶️ )**.

### Generate K6 Script

User can generate k6 script for your API with configure modal or custom prompt.

1. Click the **K6 Script** tab on toolbar to show k6 script tab.
2. Click the **Configure** icon **( ⚙️ )** to open modal.
3a. Select **Option** to setup the executor type, load profile, stages,...
3b. Select **Rules** to add sleep time and correlation rules.
3c. Select **Advanced** to add custom check and setup the environment variables.
4. Click **Apply** to generate k6 script.
5. After generating the K6 Script, user can run on the distributed cloud which provided by [k6.io](https://k6.io)

<Warning> Current API Lab **only** **support** generate K6 script for API requests. We will support the distributed cloud for performance testing in the future. </Warning>
