## Updating a translation

### Corrections

If you notice spelling or grammar errors, typos, or opportunities for better phrasing, open a pull request with your suggested fix. If you see a problem that you aren't sure of or don't have time to fix, [open an issue](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues/new/choose).

### Broken links

When tests find broken links, try to fix them across all translations. Ideally, only update the linked URLs, so that translation changes will definitely not be necessary.
