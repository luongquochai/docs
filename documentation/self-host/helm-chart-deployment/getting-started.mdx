Deploying Hoppscotch [Community](/documentation/self-host/community-edition/getting-started) and [Enterprise](/documentation/self-host/enterprise-edition/getting-started) editions with Helm charts makes it easier to manage your self-hosted instance on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). 

[Helm]((https://helm.sh)) is a package manager for Kubernetes, and [charts](https://artifacthub.io/) are pre-configured templates that automate the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes. By using Helm, you can quickly spin up a fully functional Hoppscotch instance on your cloud provider or local Kubernetes setup.
