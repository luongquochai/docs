  Create and add interactive and dynamic elements to your website using
  API Lab Widgets.
---

Widgets are interactive components that can be embedded in HTML pages to enhance
user experience. API Lab offers three types of widgets: links, buttons, and
embeds. These widgets allow you to easily integrate dynamic elements into your
website or project.

## Links

Links are the simplest way to share your API Lab requests. You can create and share
them with others in three formats: raw, HTML, and Markdown. 

Use this link to easily share your request with others or include it in
documentation and blogs.

**Example:** [Run in API Lab](https://s.dpway.io/apilab)

## Buttons

Buttons take things up a notch. These can be embedded directly into HTML or
Markdown files, and you can customize them to match your site's look and feel.

Add this button in your project's documentation, website or blogs to provide easy access to
your requests with a simple click.

**Example:**
[![Run in API Lab](https://s.dpway.io/apilab/badge.svg)](https://s.dpway.io/apilab)

## Embeds

Embeds are the most advanced widgets, allowing you to integrate a mini version
of API Lab right into your HTML page. This lets your audience interact
directly with your API requests. You can also customize how the embed looks and
functions to match your preferences.

**Example:** [See Embed in Action](https://s.dpway.io/apilab-embed-widget.netlify.app/)

<Tip>
  Customize the width, height, and other attributes of the embed code to fit
  your needs.

## Shared Request

The **Shared Request** feature allows you to create widgets like links, buttons,
and embeds that can be shared with others. When you share a request, it doesn't
give direct access to your actual request; instead, it generates a shareable
link that others can use.

<Warning>
  If a shared request uses environment variables, replace them with actual
  values before sharing to ensure it works correctly.
</Warning>
